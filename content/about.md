Hi!
I am Karl.
This is my blog where I write about things that cross my mind.

I'm the main developer of [VimTeX](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/), a Vim and Neovim plugin for writing LaTeX documents.
I've also published a few other open source projects, all of them available [on GitHub](https://github.com/lervag).
The most notable ones are probably these:

- [wiki.vim](https://github.com/lervag/wiki.vim/), a Vim and Neovim plugin for writing and maintaining a personal wiki.
- [apy](https://github.com/lervag/apy), a CLI tool for interacting with your local Anki database.

I currently work as a senior developer and tech lead at [Sikt](https://www.sikt.no).
I've previously worked at [SINTEF Energy Research](https://www.sintef.no/en/sintef-energy/) as a researcher.
