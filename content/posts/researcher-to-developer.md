I began my research career at [SINTEF Energy Research](https://www.sintef.no/en/sintef-energy/) after finishing my Master's in numerical mathematics in 2008.
My main area of research throughout my career was computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [^1].
I finished my PhD in 2013, and I stayed at SINTEF working as a research scientist until March 2022.
In April 2022, I started working as a senior backend developer at [Sikt](https://sikt.no/en/home) — this is where I'm currently still working.
In this post, I want to express some thoughts about what I've learned after my transition from being a researcher to being a developer.

I had no formal background as a developer.
Still, as a researcher working with CFD, I was used to programming and designing models for solving problems.
I was also personally interested in software development.
I've spent a lot of my spare time learning programming languages and related skills.
As an example, I built and maintained [VimTeX](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/), which is a relatively popular Vim and Neovim plugin for writing LaTeX.

An important observation is that I've found that I can be productive and useful even if I don't know everything.
As a researcher, I've learned to be thorough, structured, and analytical in how I solve problems.
Essentially, I find I am good at asking the right questions.
This is useful, because it can help me and my team to reach good solutions for our problems.

Now, I clearly lacked some skills when I started working as a developer.
To mention a few that comes to mind:

1. I didn't know the languages I started working with: Kotlin, Java, and Scala.
2. I didn't really know web development _at all_.
3. I knew little about infrastructure technologies such as Kubernetes.
4. I did not have much experience with SQL and databases.
5. I lacked a lot of the vocabulary, including things like "agile", "CDN", and "trunk-based development".

In the last three years, I feel I've learned a lot of these things.
It __really__ helped that I have been surrounded by kind and skilled colleagues that have been supportive and helpful.
Of course, there are still gaps where I both need to and want to learn more.
I enjoy learning new things, so I both believe and hope this will be true until I retire!

A final thing I want to mention:
I've now had the pleasure of working in a team where we have developed a very good and positive culture.
Now, what do I mean by this?

* I feel safe — I can express my thoughts more or less unfiltered.
* I can be curious and spend time on investigating ideas.
* I receive honest feedback on my actions and work.
* We are open and share our thoughts and ideas.
* We respect each others time and avoid unnecessary lengthy meetings
* When things are unclear or frustrating, we are good at being constructive.
  Instead of staying in a frustrated state, we start investigating how we can best proceed.

It's hard to put it in words how much value this brings to me.
And I'm very glad to have experienced it!
